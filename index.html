        <h2>Life and death</h2>
        <p>He was born in Troppau (Opava), Austrian Silesia. Bardon continued his work in the fields of <span class="bold">Hermetics</span> until 1958 when he was arrested and imprisoned in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Bardon died from pancreatitis on 10 July 1958 while in the custody of police.</p>

        <h2>Works</h2>
        <p>Bardon is best known for his three volumes on Hermetic magic. These volumes are <span class="bold">Initiation Into Hermetics, The Practice of Magical Evocation</span>  and <span class="bold">The Key to the True Kabbalah.</span></p>

        <p>An additional fourth work attributed to him by the title of <span class="bold">Frabato the Magician</span>, has been supposed by many of his students to be a disguised autobiography. Though the book lists its author as Bardon, it was actually written by his secretary, Otti Votavova. While some elements of the story are based on Bardon's real life experience, most of the book was written as an occult novel with much embellishment on the part of Votavova.</p>

        <p>Bardon's works are most notable for their simplicity, their relatively small theoretical sections, and heavy emphasis on <span class="bold">practice with many exercises.</span> Students of his, such as Emil Stejnar, Walter Ogris, Martin Faulks, William Mistele and Rawn Clark consider him to have written the best training programs of any magician of the 20th century. They were written with the intention of allowing students who wished to practice magic the means to do so if they could not study under a teacher.</p>

        <h2>Books:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Initiation Into Hermetics</span>: Initiation into Hermetics provides step-by-step instruction in the form of practical exercises. These exercises are aimed at developing body, soul and spirit. The result of the practical exercises is the development of occult abilities which can be of benefit to the student, in as far as changing his existence for the better.</li>

            <li><span class="bold">The Practice of Magical Evocation</span>: the book is a practical guide to the proper evocation of and communication with divine entities existing in the atmospheric zones surrounding planets, stars, and moon as well as in the earth itself. It is a modern study of direct contact with the universal teachers – the other major works in the field are products of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Reformation periods.</li>

            <li><span class="bold">The Key to the True Kabbalah</span>: demonstrates that mysticism of letters and numbers – the "true Kabbalah" – is a universal teaching of great antiquity and depth[citation needed]. Throughout the ages, adepts of every time and place have achieved the highest levels of magical attainment through the understanding of sound, color, number and vibration as embodied in the Kabbalah.</li>
